Telegram: @steamoffers_bot

This was my first Bot developed for Telegram.
This project was mainly my training experience in developing Bots.
It has a very simple interface and still needs some improvements that I planned 
during development. For example I planned to add "Filter" so User could choose Games, Software and other
Downloadable content that he is interested in.

What is the idea of this bot?

Using this Bot User can press the button "Get Offers" and Bot send's a Link, Image and Description for some random Special Offer
from Steam Platform that is On Sale or has Special Propositions at this moment.
Special Offers are getting from the https://store.steampowered.com/search/?specials page.
